My name is Garima Sharma.

I am a Software Developer in Bangalore, India. As a technology enthusiast, I try to keep a hang of what's going on in the flourishing world of Software. I graduated with a degree in Master's in Computer Applications from Banasthali Vidyapith University in 2016. Currently fascinated by the applications of Data Science.

I enjoy cooking, travelling and binging new shows on Netflix :)
